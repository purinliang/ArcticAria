# ArcticAria

ArcticAria is a personal life assistant designed to help you organize your daily life, discover new experiences, and share your ideas. It combines task management with personalized recommendations to create a seamless and productive experience.

## Features

### üìù Todos
Manage your daily tasks with a powerful and flexible to-do list. You can organize your tasks by categories such as **Work**, **Study**, **Life**, **Play**, and **Other**, or sort them by their time-based status, including **Overdue**, **Reminding**, **Upcoming**, and **Completed**. This helps you stay on top of your schedule and ensures nothing gets missed.

### üó∫Ô∏è Discover
Explore a world of new experiences with the Discover feature. Get recommendations for **food**, **outings** (like parks, museums, and natural landscapes), and **shopping**. Let ArcticAria know what you think by:
- Adding items to your recommendation list.
- Liking an item but snoozing it for later.
- Disliking an item.
Your feedback helps ArcticAria learn your preferences and provide smarter, more personalized suggestions over time. (Note: This feature is currently under development).
